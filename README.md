Hello World! I'm Sydney Gable, and welcome to my GitHub. 

I am an experienced biotechnology professional experimenting with projects to practice and improve my coding skills.
I mostly work with Python, but I love to challenge myself and learn new things. 

Feel free to use my code as you see fit! I learned by studying others so I would love to give back. :)
